## Solution details

_Here, explain how the challenge went. Some examples of what we'd like to read here:_
 
- _What did you wanted to do at first?_
> We would have been terrifically happy with full login/registration and sending text messages
- _What did you end up doing?_
> Started off strong, but my lack of NodeJS knowledge prevented us from accomplishing as much as we could have compared to a Python or PHP server.
- _How did it go, overall? Do you think you have succeeded?_
> Yeah I feel pretty proud of our results!
- _Is there anything that **blocked** you?_
> My lack of NodeJS knowledge (why is Javascript even a thing?)
- _Is there anything that you are **proud of**?_
> Spinning up a brand-new VM and creating a working Node server in less than 5 minutes.

_A couple of lines should be enough, just make sure we have a clear idea of what you did, so we can rate your **whole participation** and not just your **final result**._
